*(Replace `thumbnail.png` with your actual thumbnail file name if available)*

**One Media** is an experimental social media web app that brings together the **best features of all major platforms** into a single place.  
Although this project is currently incomplete, it represents an important step in my journey of learning the **MERN Stack** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📖 What I Learned

* Setting up a **MERN stack project**
* Structuring **frontend & backend code**
* Integrating **Tailwind CSS** for UI
* Handling **basic routes and APIs**
* Managing a **multi-feature project idea**

---

## 📌 Why I Stopped

I paused this project because I realized I needed to:

* Strengthen my **core skills in MERN & React**
* Learn better **project structure & scaling**
* Master concepts like **authentication, security, and performance**

This experience motivated me to **learn deeper first, then rebuild a better version** of One Media in the future.

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

* Rebuild **One Media 2.0** with cleaner code
* Add **authentication (JWT/OAuth)**
* Improve **real-time chat (Socket.IO)**
* Deploy live version for public demo

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This project is unfinished but marks an **important milestone in my learning journey**.
It reminds me that **big ideas need strong foundations**—and I’m now working on building those foundations. 💪
